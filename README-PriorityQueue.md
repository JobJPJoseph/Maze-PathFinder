## Contructor

1. The contructor will have only two properties
2. `this.heap` will be a empty array.
3. `this.length` will represent the length of `this.heap`.

## GetLeftChild

1. The function should accept a single argument representing an index that of the parent. We need to multiply by 2 with the index and add 1 bc its the left child. Return the result.

## GetRightChild

1. The function should accept a single argument representing an index that of the parent. We need to multiply by 2 with the index and add 2 bc its the right child. Return the result.

## GetParent

1. The function should accept a single argument representing an index. Should return the index substracted by 1 then divided by 2 and floor it.

## Enqueue

1.

## BinarySortUp

## Dequeue

## BinarySortDown
