# Format Maze

In this file, our goal is to retrieve the file and format into a 2-D matrix

## contructor

1. We need to accept a file that we are trying to format and make it a property called `this.maze`.
2. Make a property called `this.matrix` that represents an empty array
3. Lastly we need to call a function `formatMatrix` that will update `this.matrix`.

## formatMatrix

The maze is represented as a string data. Notice that each line ends in `\n`. Our goal is to populate `this.matrix` as a matrix so that that we could traverse it.

## printMatrix

The function iterate though `this.matrix` and print the matrix.
